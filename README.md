# React Native Expo Project

This project is built using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [Expo](https://expo.io/), providing a comprehensive and robust framework for building native applications for both iOS and Android from a single codebase.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Expo CLI](https://expo.io/tools#cli)

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/Premodial/Interview004.git)
cd Interview004-main
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

This will start the Expo development server. You can now run the app on your phone by scanning the QR code from the Expo client app.

## Running the Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:

```bash
npm run test
```
